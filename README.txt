HOW TO RUN:
Run format.py with the tweets json file as an input. For example, 'python format.py gg2013.json'.
To test on other Golden Globe years, add award names list on top in format.py and modify the if statement to include json file name and award names list name.

The packages we used are NLTK, re, json, sys, and operator. NLTK can be found here: https://www.nltk.org/install.html
