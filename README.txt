HOW TO RUN:
Run format.py with the tweets json file and award_names.py as an input. For example, 'python format.py gg2013.json award_names.py'. award_names.py contains the hardcoded list of awards for presenters, nominees, and winner.
The packages we used are NLTK, re, json, sys, and operator. NLTK can be found here: https://www.nltk.org/install.html
